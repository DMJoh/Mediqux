## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-13

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Patient Date of Birth Timezone Fix
- **Fixed date of birth display issue** - Patient date of birth now displays the correct date in all timezones instead of showing previous day
- **Resolved UTC midnight conversion problem** - Date-only fields now use UTC date components to prevent timezone-induced date shifts
- **Universal date support** - Patient birth dates display correctly for users in negative timezones (GMT-5, GMT-8, etc.)
- **Consistent date representation** - Birth dates show the same in patient list, edit forms, and detail views

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Enhanced date handling in `patients.js` using `getUTCDate()`, `getUTCMonth()`, `getUTCFullYear()` for date-only fields
- Improved date display logic to prevent timezone conversion of midnight UTC timestamps
- Better handling of date vs datetime field differences in frontend

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-13

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Timezone Handling
- **Fixed appointment timezone conversion issue** - Appointments now save and display in correct local time instead of showing UTC offset errors
- **Resolved datetime-local input handling** - Frontend properly converts local time to UTC for storage and back to local time for display
- **Universal timezone support** - System now works correctly for any user timezone (GMT+5:30, GMT-5, etc.)
- **Fixed edit form datetime population** - Edit forms now show the original time entered instead of displaying UTC time with offset

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Enhanced datetime handling in `appointments.js` for proper timezone conversion
- Improved datetime-local input value processing for consistent behavior across timezones
- Better separation of concerns between frontend time display and backend UTC storage
